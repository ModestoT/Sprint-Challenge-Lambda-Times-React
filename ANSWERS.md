4.What are three different ways to style components in React? Explain some of the benefits of each.
    Normal CSS, which allows you to have you styles in a seperate file and if you code base is large could also save time by being easier to update it compared to other methods.
    Using Reactstrap,  which provides you with already built out components that you can already use.
    Or Styled-components, which allows you to CSS code inside of the React file for that specific component. Can customize the element more easily than you can with Reactstrap.
